# About Me
## My Interest
Some of my interests include playing chess and the piano. In the future, I hope to become very adept with computer systems and technology overall as well as finance.

## Websites I Recommend
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) - I think that YouTube's massive collection of content is why it is so nice to use, you're essentially able to search for almost anything.
- [Google](https://www.google.co.uk/) - Google is very similar to YouTube in the sense that it has unlimited amounts of information at anyone and everyone's disposal at all times and that's why I like it.
